# Dutch Cities
An example to visualize/animate Mesa models on a continuous canvas with Earth coordinates. 

![Demo](DutchCities.gif)

## How to Run
* Launch the visualization
```
    $ python model_viz.py
```

## Files

* [model.py](model.py): Contains the model `DutchCitiesModel` and the `CityAgent` class. During the model generation, given bounds of the latitude and longitude in Decimal Degrees (DD) are translated into the bounds of the HTML5 canvas. 
  
* [SimpleContinuousModule.py](SimpleContinuousModule.py): Defines ``SimpleCanvas``, the Python side of a custom visualization module for drawing objects with continuous positions. This is a slight adaptation of the Flocker example provided by the Mesa project. 
  
* [simple_continuous_canvas.js](simple_continuous_canvas.js): JavaScript side of the ``SimpleCanvas`` visualization module. It takes the output generated by the Python ``SimpleCanvas`` element and draws it in the browser window via HTML5 canvas. It can draw circles and rectangles. Both can have text annotation. This file is an adaptation of the Flocker example provided by the Mesa project.
  
* [model_viz.py](model_viz.py): Sets up the visualization; uses the `SimpleCanvas` element defined above. Call the model. Run the visualization server.
  
* [DutchCities.csv](DutchCities.csv): The data of Dutch cities (population, lat, lon) used to generate city agents. 
  
* [DutchCities.ipynb](DutchCities.ipynb): Tests the data in a Jupyter notebook.
